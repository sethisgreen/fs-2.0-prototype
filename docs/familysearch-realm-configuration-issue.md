**Subject:** OAuth Client Realm Configuration Issue

**Message Template:**

```
Hello FamilySearch Developer Support,

I'm developing an application that integrates with the FamilySearch API using OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow.

**Issue:** When attempting OAuth authorization, I receive the error:
"Validation exception. Client needs a realm configured for openid-connect"

**Client Details:**
- Client ID: [YOUR_CLIENT_ID]
- Application Type: Web Application (Public Client)
- Redirect URI: https://fs-agent.com/oauth/callback
- OAuth Flow: Authorization Code Flow

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to: https://identbeta.familysearch.org/cis-web/oauth2/v3/authorization?response_type=code&client_id=[CLIENT_ID]&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Ffs-agent.com%2Foauth%2Fcallback&state=test
2. Complete FamilySearch login
3. Receive error: "Client needs a realm configured for openid-connect"

**Questions:**
1. What realm configuration is required for OpenID Connect?
2. How should I configure the client for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow?
3. Are there specific settings needed in the FamilySearch Developer Portal?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

### 2. Alternative Approaches

#### Option A: Use Unauthenticated Sessions

- Continue with current unauthenticated session access
- Limited but functional for basic API calls
- Good for testing and development

#### Option B: Request Realm Configuration

- Contact FamilySearch support
- Provide client details and use case
- Request proper realm configuration

#### Option C: Use Different OAuth Flow

- Test if other grant types work
- Explore alternative authentication methods

## üìä **Current Working Capabilities**

With unauthenticated sessions, we can access:

- ‚úÖ Collection metadata
- ‚úÖ Date authority information
- ‚úÖ Basic API structure

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Immediate:** Continue development with unauthenticated sessions
2. **Short-term:** Contact FamilySearch support about realm configuration
3. **Long-term:** Implement full OAuth once realm is configured
